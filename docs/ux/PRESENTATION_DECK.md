# Slide 3: Journeys Analyzed

## 5 Critical Workflows Mapped

| Journey | Duration | Stages | Users Affected |
|---------|----------|--------|----------------|
| **1. Courier Onboarding** | 5-7 days | 6 | HR, Fleet Mgr, Trainer, Courier |
| **2. Daily Dispatch Flow** | 14 hours | 6 | Dispatcher, 40-60 Couriers |
| **3. Delivery Lifecycle** | 30-90 min | 6 | Courier, Customer, Dispatcher |
| **4. Incident Resolution** | Hours-Weeks | 6 | Supervisor, HR, Fleet, Legal |
| **5. Leave Request** | 14 days | 6 | Courier, Supervisor, HR |

**Total Touchpoints Analyzed:** 50+
**Systems Involved:** 8+ (BARQ, FMS, Platforms, WhatsApp, Excel, Email, etc.)

---

# Slide 4: Critical Findings - The Big 3

## 1. No Courier Mobile App ⚠️ CRITICAL

**Impact:**
- 8 status update calls per delivery
- Manual COD tracking (theft risk)
- No self-service for couriers
- Leave requests via WhatsApp

**Affects:** 3 out of 5 journeys (60%)

---

## 2. Manual Dispatch Allocation ⚠️ CRITICAL

**Impact:**
- 90 minutes to assign 200+ deliveries
- Mental route optimization
- No auto-assignment algorithm
- Dispatcher burnout

**Affects:** Primary operational bottleneck

---

## 3. System Fragmentation ⚠️ CRITICAL

**Impact:**
- 5+ disconnected tools
- Manual data transfer
- 200+ manual entries daily
- No API integrations

**Affects:** All 5 journeys (100%)

---

# Slide 5: Pain Point Patterns

## Recurring Themes Across All Journeys

```
Theme                          Frequency    Severity
────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Manual Processes                 100%       ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
System Fragmentation             100%       ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
No Mobile Access                  80%       ⭐⭐⭐⭐
Poor Real-Time Visibility        100%       ⭐⭐⭐⭐
No Workflow Automation           100%       ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
Heavy Data Entry Burden           80%       ⭐⭐⭐⭐
Informal Communication            60%       ⭐⭐⭐
No Platform Integrations          40%       ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
Reactive (not Proactive)         100%       ⭐⭐⭐
No Self-Service Options           80%       ⭐⭐⭐
```

**Bottom Line:** System works, but is highly manual and fragmented
